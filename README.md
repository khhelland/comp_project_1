comp_project_1
==============
These are the source files for project 1 in the course fys3150--computional physics at UIO.
After compiling the c++ programs project_1_b.cpp and LU.cpp, running the python program plotter.py
 will run the programs several times and save 
some figures and tables to file. Some of the tables are formatted to be pasted into a tex-file.
